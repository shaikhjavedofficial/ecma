    • When on console use shift+enter to go next line for the executable.
    • While initializing variable one method is var a = 10, b = 20
    • The backslash \ breaks the string also used for multi-line string
      ex: “this is \“an example\” of \
          multiline string”
    • string properties : to find length ----- var.length
    • string methods:
			to change to uppercase ----- var.toUpperCase()
			to change to lowercase ----- var.toLowerCase()
			etc
    • Number :
		js consider 10 and 10.0 same as 10, if the i/p is 10.236 then the o/p is 10.236
		js supports infinity as Infinity keyword
		if your math have error then you will NaN which not a number.
		Js have built in methods of number handling, but for math we Math.method(), ex: var a = 10.23 ; Math.round(a)
    • objects:
          ex: var Obj1 = {
          number1 : 1,
          “string1” : “some data”,
          }
