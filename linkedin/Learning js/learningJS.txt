    • When on console use shift+enter to go next line for the executable.
    • While initializing variable one method is var a = 10, b = 20
    • The backslash \ breaks the string also used for multi-line string
      ex: “this is \“an example\” of \
          multiline string”
    • string properties : to find length ----- var.length
    • string methods:
			to change to uppercase ----- var.toUpperCase()
			to change to lowercase ----- var.toLowerCase()
			etc
    • Number :
		js consider 10 and 10.0 same as 10, if the i/p is 10.236 then the o/p is 10.236
		js supports infinity as Infinity keyword
		if your math have error then you will NaN which not a number.
		Js have built in methods of number handling, but for math we Math.method(), ex: var a = 10.23 ; Math.round(a)

objects:
          ex: var Obj1 = {
          number1 : 1,
          “string1” : “some data”,
          }
	    obj1.number1 or obj1[‘number’] will give 1, but to get string1 we have use obj1[“string1”], when we have an id with double qoute or with space then we have to use  square brackets
	    to assign an value to any key -- obj.number1 = 10
	    to add an key and value to object –- 1. obj[“name”] = “javed”
2. obj.address = “inda”

    • to delete properties from object use ‘delete’ keyword
delete obj.number1
    • when we assign an obj into another obj it doesn’t make a copy it only references to original obj, so if change any one obj the other will change,
      ex. var obj = {
      name:”javed”,
      location :”india”
      }                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
      var obj1 =obj
      obj1.name = “shaikh”
      obj ==> {
      name:”shaikh”,
      location :”india”
      }
    • to make an copy of the object use obj1 = JSON.parse(JSON.stingify(obj))

Arrays
    • an array contains the property length
      var array1 = [1,2, “string1”, true]
      array1.lenght – – 3
    • to add item to array 
      array1[4] = “javed” --- this will add “javed” at index 4
      array1[array1.length] = 4545 --- this will add at last index
    • another method to add item at last index is push (array1.push(“Fdfd”)) and to remove the last index item is pop (array1.pop())
    • to remove an specific item from array use splice ( array.splice(item_index_to_Remove, how_many_items_to_remove) )
      array1.splice(2,1) ---- “string1”  will be remove
