three types of js loading in html
1. default:
    here js will load whenever the browser encounter the js and will stop the html rendering
    till js is downloaded and executed
    ex: <script src="js/add.js"></script>

2. async:
    here the html rendering and js downloading and execution happens in parallel way
    ex: <script src ="js/add.js" async></script>

3. defer:
    here the html rendering and js downloading happens in parallel way but the execution after the rendering
    ex: <script src ="js/add.js" defer></script>
